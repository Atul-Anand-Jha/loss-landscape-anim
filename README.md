# Animating the Optimization Trajectory of Neural Nets

`loss-landscape-anim` is a library that lets you create animations for the loss landscape of your neural networks. It is inspired by the paper [Visualizing the Loss Landscape of Neural Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09913v3).

Check out my article [Visualizing Optimization Trajectory of Neural Nets](https://towardsdatascience.com/from-animation-to-intuition-visualizing-optimization-trajectory-in-neural-nets-726e43a08d85?sk=dae85760fb921ecacddbe1af903e3c69) for more example gifs.

## Example

```py
# TODO: Add example for python and cli using fastcore.script
```

## Implementation

This library is based on PyTorch, matplotlib and used `fastcore.script` to build the command line interface.
